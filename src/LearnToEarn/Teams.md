# Teams

Big teams have a higher chance to win. If the team wins, the prize is distributed as follows:

* 30% of prize to the team leader.
* 70% of prize to the team member (picked randomly every time).

The team leader receives guaranteed 30% if the team wins - this is his payment for creating the team (bringing people together).

The team members have a random chance to receive 70% of prize. The chance depends on their capital - same calculation, but within the team.  

In the future, we'll add more questions & allow the team leader to answer some questions for team members. This will further justify the guaranteed payout of the leader.
