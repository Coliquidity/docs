# Coliquidity Learn-To-Earn Game

You can win up to $1000 BUSD in every round of the Coliquidity game. The game is based on a Learn-To-Earn concept: you need to answer questions about Coliquidity in order to win the prize.

## How to win

The round starts every Thursday at 07:00 UTC. The round lasts for 24 hours. During the round, you need to answer 1 question about [Coliquidity](../WhatIsColiquidity.md). The winning probability depends on the amount of assets that you're holding ([learn more](#how-is-the-winning-probability-calculated)).

### Formulas

#### Winning Probability

Winning Probability = [Your Capital](#your-capital) / [Total Capital](#total-capital)

#### Your Capital

Your Capital = Sum of [Capital on each of your Addresses](#capital-on-address)

#### Total Capital

Total Capital = Sum of [Capital on all participating Addresses](#capital-on-address)

#### Capital On Address

Capital On Address = Sum of [USD Equivalents](#usd-equivalent) of [Assets](#assets) on Address

#### USD Equivalent

USD Equivalent = [Multiplier for Asset](#multiplier) × Amount of Asset × Price of Asset in USD at the start of the round

#### Assets

Supported assets: [COLI](../COLI/FAQ.md), ETH, BNB, WETH, WBNB, USDT, USDC, BUSD, DAI

We're open to adding more assets in the future.

#### Multiplier

Multiplier = 3 for COLI, 1 for others.

COLI holders have an advantage in the game. However, it is not a hard requirement to hold COLI - it's possible to win even without it. The game is designed to maximize participation, so that more people learn about Coliquidity and our upcoming [Rewards Program](../Rewards/Summary.md).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How is the winning probability calculated?

Your winning probability depends on how much money you have on your address. Higher balance = higher chance of winning.

This is required to fight the bots - otherwise they could submit many addresses with zero balances.

If you have multiple addresses, you can submit all of them in a single answer, and we'll sum the balances on them. No need to answer multiple times.

### How is it related to Rewards Program?

The Learn-To-Earn Game is a "smaller cousin" of [The Rewards Program](../Rewards/Summary.md). The game is easier to start with, because you don't need to hold the COLI token. However, the game prize is a fixed amount, whereas in the Rewards Program payout is 1% weekly (scales up with your deposit).
