# Why should I use Coliquidity as a long-term investor?

As a long-term investor, you can accumulate a large long position without slippage & fees.

- **Save money** - build a gigalong without slippage & trading fees (the project provides the tokens, you provide the ETH, smart contract puts your liquidity together into the pool).
- **Maximize profit** - receive liquidity provider fees while holding a gigalong position.

Drawbacks:

- Short-term profit is lower. However:
  - Short-term loss is lower (same risk-reward ratio).
  - Long-term profit is higher: LP fees are always positive (**better** risk-reward ratio with additional fees).
