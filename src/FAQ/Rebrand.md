# Rebrand FAQ

## What is happening?

Shield Finance is rebranding to Coliquidity. It's a new product that allows users to provide one-sided liquidity for any token pair ([learn more](../HowItWorks.md)). Thus, we are changing the following:

- <https://shieldfinance.io/> -> <https://www.coliquidity.com/>
- $SHLD token on Ethereum -> $COLI token on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (token name update + bridge)
- $BULL token on Ethereum -> $BULL token on Binance Smart Chain (full token migration)

## When is it happening?

We will announce the official date on our social media channels.

As of Jan 15, 2022, we have already completed [the landing page](https://dev.shieldfinance.io/), and we are not working on finalizing the token migration script.

## How do I claim the $COLI token?

You don't need to claim the $COLI token - it will be airdropped automatically to the same address where you hold $SHLD.

Simply hold $SHLD at the [migration date](#when-is-it-happening), and you will receive $COLI.

## How do I claim the $BULL token?

After the migration happens, you should follow the same process as in "[How to claim $BULL token airdrop
](https://shield-finance.medium.com/how-to-claim-bull-token-airdrop-7255443fd704)" (using the new contract on Binance Smart Chain).

We will provide more details closer to the [migration date](#when-is-it-happening).

## Do I need to pay a fee to claim the tokens?

- To claim $COLI: no fee.
- To claim $BULL: single transaction fee.

## What will happen with old $SHLD and $BULL tokens?

They will be paused forever.
