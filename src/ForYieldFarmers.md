# Why should I use Coliquidity as a yield farmer?

As a yield farmer, you can provide ETH without buying the tokens:

- **Save money** - don’t buy the 2nd asset, save on slippage & trading fees.
- **Minimize risk** - Avoid holding 2 assets at the same time.
  Drawbacks:
- Some projects may not have a Coliquidity pool. Solution:
  - Use a combined strategy: if there’s a Coliquidity pool, provide only one token, if not, provide both tokens.
