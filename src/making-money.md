# What’s the best way to make money with Coliquidity?

Coliquidity is better suited for long-term holding. You can make more money this way, because you will accumulate more LP fees. Meanwhile, if the token continues to go up, you’ll also capitalize on the uptrend.

Coliquidity profit = Trend profit + LP fees profit.

Since “LP fees profit” is always positive, it is always better to use Coliquidity than simply buying and holding without providing liquidity.
