## FAQ

### How much can I earn as a team leader?

It is very profitable to be a team leader. See the calculation:

* You invest $500.
* You attract 2 team members who invest $5000 each ($10000 total).
* You get $35 **weekly** ($30 from your team deposit + $5 from your own deposit).
* $35 weekly = $1820 in a year.

If $COLI price doubles, you get double reward ([see why](FAQ.md#how-much-exactly-can-i-get)).

You can also sell $COLI later.

### How can I create a team?

Just ask other people to [join your team](#how-can-i-join-a-team) by giving them your publicly available wallet address. You can use an existing address or create a new one.

Your public wallet address is your team ID. So technically, you already have a team. However, only teams with 3+ members qualify for bonuses - that's why you should team up with your followers.

### How can I join a team?

* Open our app (*under construction*)
* Enter team leader's address
* Confirm the transaction

This transaction doesn't send any money - it only confirms your team membership.

### Can I change the team?

Yes.

### Can I create a team with only myself?

No, every team needs at least 3 members (you + 2 additional members).

We will disqualify people for creating fake teams.
