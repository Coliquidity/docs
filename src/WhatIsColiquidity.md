# What is Coliquidity?

Coliquidity is **a new way to trade crypto**:

- More profitable than buying tokens ([proof](FAQ.md#why-coliquidity-is-more-profitable-than-buying-tokens)).
- Less risky than providing liquidity ([proof](Risks.md#why-coliquidity-is-less-risky-than-providing-liquidity)).

Normally you need to deposit two tokens into the liquidity pool to earn liquidity provider fees. However, Coliquidity allows you to deposit **only one token**. You don’t need to buy the other token at all. Coliquidity will match your deposit with someone else’s deposit for another token.

Benefits:

- You get liquidity provider fees
- You get liquidity mining bonuses (if they are provided by the project)
- You don’t pay the trading fees (you earn them instead)
- You don’t lose on slippage.

Drawbacks:

- You may need to wait for a matching deposit.

Technical description: Coliquidity is a smart contract that combines 2 tokens from 2 providers to create a new pool or deposit into an existing pool on Uniswap / PancakeSwap / any exchange.
