# Why should I use Coliquidity as a project owner?

As a project owner, you can create the pool without providing ETH - just provide the tokens and allow community members to provide ETH (works with BNB / MATIC / AVAX, too):

- **Save your capital** - don’t use it to create the pool, allow other people to add liquidity.
- **Get more liquidity** - simplify the process of adding liquidity into your pool after creation.

Drawbacks:

- Community members can remove liquidity in the future. Solutions:
  - Lock liquidity by setting a date until which they can’t withdraw.
  - Incentivize holding liquidity through a [liquidity mining program](FAQ.md#is-liquidity-mining-possible-with-coliquidity).
