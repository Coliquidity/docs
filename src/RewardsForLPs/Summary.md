# Rewards Program For Liquidity Providers

**Terms:**

* You can get **20% APY** on your USDT, USDC or BUSD deposit.
* To get the rewards, you should provide liquidity into our pool on PancakeSwap.
* To increase your APY, you should create or join an LP team.

**Our LP program is low risk:**

* You **don't need** to buy COLI, we will provide it ourselves. You should only provide BUSD.
* Your risk is lower compared to traditional LP programs, since you only need to provide BUSD (stablecoin).
* This is possible because of [Coliquidity](../WhatIsColiquidity.md), which allows 2 providers to deposit 1 token from each side. It matches 2 liquidity providers before depositing their tokens into a liquidity pool.

[Coliquidity](../WhatIsColiquidity.md) is our product. This program is our marketing initiative to get people to learn about Coliquidity.
