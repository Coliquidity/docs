## Why should I use Coliquidity as a project owner?

As a project owner, you can create the pool without providing ETH - just provide the tokens and allow community members to provide ETH (works with BNB / MATIC / AVAX, too):

- **Save your capital** - don’t use it to create the pool, allow other people to add liquidity.
- **Get more liquidity** - simplify the process of adding liquidity into your pool after creation.
  Drawbacks:
- Community members can remove liquidity in future. Solutions:
- Lock liquidity by setting a date until which they can’t withdraw.
- Incentivize holding liquidity through a [liquidity mining program](#for-existing-non-stablecoin-pools).

## Why should I use Coliquidity as a yield farmer?

As a yield farmer, you can provide ETH without buying the tokens:

- **Save money** - don’t buy the 2nd asset, save on slippage & trading fees.
- **Minimize risk** - Avoid holding 2 assets at the same time.
  Drawbacks:
- Some projects may not have a Coliquidity pool. Solution:
- Use a combined strategy: if there’s a Coliquidity pool, provide only one token, if not, provide both tokens.

## Why should I use Coliquidity as a long-term investor?

As a long-term investor, you can accumulate a large long position without slippage & fees.

- **Save money** - build a gigalong without slippage & trading fees (the project provides the tokens, you provide the ETH, smart contract puts your liquidity together into the pool).
- **Maximize profit** - receive liquidity provider fees while holding a gigalong position.
  Drawbacks:
- Short-term profit is lower. However:
- Short-term loss is lower (same risk-reward ratio).
- Long-term profit is higher: LP fees are always positive (**better** risk-reward ratio with additional fees).
