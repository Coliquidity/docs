## FAQ

### How can I create a team?

Just ask other people to [join your team](#how-can-i-join-a-team) by giving them your publicly available wallet address.

Your public wallet address is your team ID. So technically, you already have a team. However, only teams with 3+ members qualify for bonuses - that's why you need to team up with other people.

### How can I join a team?

* Open UI (*under construction*)
* Enter team leader's address
* Confirm the transaction

This transaction doesn't send any money - it only confirms your team membership.

### Can I change the team?

Yes.

### Will I receive additional rewards if I join the team in the middle of the payout period?

Yes, you will receive additional rewards proportional to the time you were in a team. For example, if you join a team on Monday, you will receive additional `+10% * (1 / 7)` on Tuesday (because you were in a team for 1 of 7 days).

### Can I create a team with only myself?

No, you need at least 3 members.

We will disqualify people for creating fake teams.
