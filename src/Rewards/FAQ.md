## What questions should I answer?

The questions will be about [Coliquidity](../WhatIsColiquidity.md) (our product). We will prepare 3-5 new questions every week. The questions form will be protected by a CAPTCHA to stop the bots.

## How will you pay the rewards?

We'll use the "Rewards" allocation according to the tokenomics.

## How long will you run the rewards program?

We plan to run the rewards program indefinitely, until we will be getting new users for Coliquidity (our product).

## Can I sell $COLI later?

Yes.

## Why are you doing this?

We want to get users for [Coliquidity](../WhatIsColiquidity.md) (our product). We require people to answer questions about our product to get the rewards.

## If I buy now, will I get rewards at the next distribution?

Yes, you will get rewards proportionally. For example, if you buy on Monday, you will receive 1% * 1/7 on Tuesday (because you held for 1 of 7 days).
