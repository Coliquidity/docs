# Rewards Program FAQ

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD001 -->

### How can I get the rewards?

* [Buy COLI](#how-can-i-buy-the-coli-token)
* [Lock COLI](Locks.md)
* [Answer questions](#what-questions-should-i-answer) each week.

If you don't want to answer the questions, you can [join the team](Teams.md), and the team leader will do it for you.

### How much exactly can I get?

* You can get 1% weekly (67% APY) on your COLI deposit in BUSD.
* Exact formula: `PriceOfColi * AmountOfColi * 1%`
* Example:
  * You invest $2000 to buy 1000000 COLI at $0.0020.
  * COLI price goes 2x up to $0.0040.
  * Your deposit value increases to $4000.
  * You get paid `0.0040 * 1000000 * 1%` = `$4000 * 1%` = `$40` in one week.

### When can I get the rewards?

Every week on Tuesday at 10:00 UTC.

### If I buy COLI now, when do I get the rewards?

You will get the rewards at the next distribution date + every week afterwards.

For the first week, you will get rewards proportionally to the deposit active time.
